//! Daemon-side orchestration for attaching a repo to a live session (#3103).
//!
//! [`crate::session::attach_project`] does the filesystem and persistence half.
//! This module is the part that needs the daemon: quiescing the session, making
//! the conversion durable, and starting the worker again so the agent comes up in
//! the workspace, without losing the conversation.
//!
//! ## Why a stop and start rather than a refusal
//!
//! The "edit workdir name" endpoint refuses while a session is active, because it
//! moves the directory out from under a running worker and that crash-looped the
//! worker in #2260. Attaching moves the directory too, so the same hazard applies,
//! but refusing would gut the feature: the whole point is that you realize you
//! need the second repo mid-task. So this does what the rename could not, and
//! takes the session down for the move rather than doing it live. #2346 asks for
//! exactly that default.
//!
//! What the sequence needs is a barrier. Between the shutdown and the respawn the
//! session's recorded working directory is changing under it, and checking "is a
//! turn in flight" and then acting is not enough because a turn can start in the
//! gap. So the whole sequence is held under the per-session `instance_lock`, the
//! same lock the tied-worktree rename holds across its `git worktree move` plus
//! metadata write, and the turn probe runs inside it. Since #3621 that takes two
//! locks, not one: prompt submission has its own per-session authority and never
//! takes `instance_lock`, so the barrier holds `prompt_submission` outside it.
//!
//! ## Why the split against the session-domain half
//!
//! `plan` validates without writing, `attach_planned` writes. The daemon needs
//! them separate because its quiesce is async (`shutdown_and_wait` on the
//! supervisor) and cannot run inside the blocking closure that owns `Storage`,
//! and because a refusal must never cost the user a stopped session.
