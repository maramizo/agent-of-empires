//! Attach a repo to a session that already exists, by converting it into a
//! multi-repo workspace (#3103).
//!
//! Creation-time multi-repo lives in [`super::builder::create_workspace`], which
//! lays every repo out under one aoe-created workspace directory. That shape used
//! to be reachable only at creation, so realizing mid-task that you also need the
//! frontend repo meant destroying the session. This module is the post-creation
//! counterpart, and it produces the *same* shape: after attaching, a session is
//! indistinguishable from one created multi-repo, with both repos side by side in
//! one workspace directory and `workspace_info.repos` listing them.
//!
//! Converting rather than keeping a second list of "attached" repos is the whole
//! design. The alternative, leaving the session where it is and pointing the agent
//! at a worktree parked somewhere else, needs the ACP `additional_directories`
//! capability, a sandbox path-map entry per extra root, and a degradation path for
//! agents that do not advertise it, and it still leaves a session that only half
//! looks multi-repo. Landing both repos under the session `cwd` needs none of that.
//!
//! Three starting shapes, one result:
//!
//! - **Already a workspace**: the new repo's worktree is created inside the
//!   existing `workspace_dir`. Nothing moves.
//! - **Worktree session**: a new workspace directory is created and the session's
//!   existing worktree is moved into it with `git worktree move`, so uncommitted
//!   work travels with it.
//! - **In-place session**: a new workspace directory gets a *fresh* worktree of
//!   the session's repo. The user's own checkout is never moved or deleted, which
//!   is why this case refuses when that checkout is dirty: the session's cwd moves
//!   to the new worktree and uncommitted work would be left behind.
//!
//! Two invariants shape the code below.
//!
//! **`workspace_dir` only ever contains worktrees aoe created.** That is why the
//! in-place case creates a worktree instead of adopting the user's checkout.
//! `deletion` still verifies the layout with `workspace_dir_is_aoe_owned` rather
//! than trusting the record, and its final removal is non-recursive, so anything
//! else still sitting under the directory keeps it on disk instead of being
//! deleted with it.
//!
//! **A branch aoe did not create is never touched.** The session's branch name is a
//! suggestion. If the added repo already has that branch, the attach refuses unless
//! the caller explicitly opts into reusing it, and the reuse is recorded on the
//! repo (`branch_preexisting`) so session deletion leaves the branch alone.
